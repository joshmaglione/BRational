Documentation for the BRational package for SageMath . Purpose The goal of BRational is to format certain rational functions in SageMath in a particular format. These rational functions contain the class of generating series, which is our primary use case. The main purpose is to enable users to manipulate such expressions and to rewrite expressions for ease of comprehension. Setup The simplest way to install BRational is to run the following $ sage --pip install brational Alternatively, one can download the latest release and unzip it into a directory that SageMath can find for importing. To update an older version of BRational to the latest version, run the following $ sage --pip install brational --upgrade BRational has no external dependencies and is compatible with SageMath 9.6 and later. It may work just fine with earlier versions of SageMath, but these have not been tested. Importing Import BRational during your SageMath run with the following import brational as br Throughout this documentation, we use br for the reference name of brational .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#brational","text":"Author: Joshua Maglione .
